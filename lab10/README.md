## Feedback:
This lab is very helpful. Writing these shell script makes me understand the foundation of operating system more. I really enjoy reading system information and making directory or output memory usage directly using the shell command. Knowing these saves a lot of time and energy and also save a lot of memory space because these shell script are fast and small.
